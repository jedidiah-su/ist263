        Hi there, Welcome! 
My name is Jedidiah Koubiessi, and I am majoring in Information Management and Technology with a concentration in Cybersecurity alongside a minor in Marketing. 
I am deeply interested in how technology, data, and innovation can be used to solve real-world problems, improve decision-making, and create meaningful impact across industries while being conscious to take into deep consideration the impact these technologies have on its consumers. 
My academic interests include information security, data analysis, emerging technologies, and the intersection of technology and business strategy especially for marginalized communities.
I am a first-generation honors student, a SHECAN Scholar, and an Invest in Success Scholar. I have developed skills in data analysis, research, problem-solving, and digital tools, with hands-on experience working with data visualization tools and technology-driven projects. 
Known for my curiosity and discipline, I am passionate about continuous learning and leveraging technology to drive equity and opportunity.
Outside of my academic and professional work, I enjoy travelling, immersing myself in different cultures and cooking. 
As an international student from Liberia, my global background has shaped my perspective, resilience, and adaptability. I value community, mentorship, and meaningful conversations, and I bring a thoughtful, purpose-driven approach to everything I do. Driven by both ambition and impact, I aim to build a career at the intersection of technology, data, and social good, where I can contribute to forward-thinking solutions and inspire others along the way.
